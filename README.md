## Project Setup üõ†Ô∏è
Clone this repo.
```
git clone https://github.com/Raulms29/electron-forge-template.git
```
Then access the created folder and run the following command:
```
npm run build
```
This will download the necessary dependencies, compile the project and create the resources needed for the installer in the `out` folder. The installer will be located at `out/make`.
Once the build is done, to test the project without an installation use:
```
npm start
```
Try the unit testing with:
```
npm run test
```
Or the component testing with:
```
npm run test:component
```
Try the e2e testing with:
```
npm run test:e2e
```
